#' Permute costmatrices
#'
#' @description
#'
#' Given vectors of states and costs, permutes all possible costmatrices.
#'
#' @param states A vector of character states, e.g., "0", "1", "2".
#' @param costs A vector of numeric costs, e.g., 1, 2, Inf.
#' @param symmetry Must be one of \code{"Symmetric"}, \code{"Asymmetric"} or \code{"both"}.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' Costmatrices define the cost of each state-to-state transition, but they are restricted in what these costs can be (see \link{check_costMatrix}). Nevertheless, strictly speaking there are infinite possible costmatrices - even where costs are restricted to integer values (as TNT does; Goloboff et al. 2008; Goloboff and Catalano 2016), i.e., "stepmatrices" (Swofford and Maddison 1992). Thus this function operates on a finite system by requiring the user to specify a restricted set of states and individual cost values, with the function permuting every possible combination of finite costs. Note that not \link{every} permutation will be returned as not all of these will be valid costmatrices (see \link{check_costMatrix} and \link{fix_costMatrix}). Others will not be returned because their cost \emph{ratio} can be considered redundant. For example, for a binary character (states "0", and "1") the following two costmatrices would be mutually redundant as the ratio of their costs is identical:
#'
#' \preformatted{  A B
#' A 0 1
#' B 2 0
#'
#'   A B
#' A 0 2
#' B 4 0}
#'
#' (If the user does want to consider these kinds of alternatives then a better solution is to simply weight the first matrix by two, or any other value, in any downstream analys(es).)
#'
#' For the function to work costs must be unique positive values. This includes infinity (\code{Inf} in R). Infinite costs can be used to denote a particular transition is impossible and allows defining (e.g.) irreversible characters, or those that force a particular root value.
#'
#' @return A list of unique costmatrices containing every possible combination of costs.
