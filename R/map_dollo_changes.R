#' Stochastic Character Map For Dollo Character
#'
#' @description
#'
#' Given a tree with binary tip states produces a stochastic Dollo character map.
#'
#' @param time_tree A tree in phylo format with positive branch lengths and a value for \code{$root.time}.
#' @param tip_states A named vector of tip states (must be 0 or 1), where the names match \code{tree$tip.label}.
#'
#' @details
#'
#' The non-ideal solution from Tarver et al. (2018) to the problem of generating a stochastic character map for a Dollo character (i.e., a single gain of the derived state, 1) with any number of losses (1 -> 0).
#'
#' The function operates as follows:
#'
#' 1) Establishes the least inclusive clade exhibiting the derived state (1).
#' 2) Assumes a single gain occurred with equal probability along the branch subtending this clade.
#' 3) Prunes the inclusive clade to generate a subtree with a strong root prior of the derived state (1).
#' 4) Calls \code{make.simmap} from the \code{phytools} package to generate a stochastic character map using a model where only losses are possible.
#' 5) Outputs both the stochastic character map (time spent in each state on each branch) and a matrix of state changes.
#'
#' NB: As the map is stochastic the answer will be different each time the function is run and multiple replicates are strongly advised in order to characterise this uncertainty.
#'
#' @return
#'
#' \item{changes}{A matrix of all changes (gains and losses).}
#' \item{stochastic_character_map}{The stochastic character map.}
